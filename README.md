--Q1 [Python]-- The probability of rain on a given calendar day in Vancouver is p[i], where i is the day's index. For example, p[0] is the probability of rain on January 1 , and p[10] is the probability of precipitation on January 11 . Assume the year has 365 days (i.e. p has 365 elements). What is the chance it rains more than n (e.g. 100) days in Vancouver? Write a function that accepts p (probabilities of rain on a given calendar day) and n as input arguments and returns the possibility of raining at least n days.
<span style="color:red">ANSWER.</span>  if we want 365>=n>= 100 days to be rainy, we have to choose n days from the 365 days to be rainy. The other (365 -n ) days are going to be not rainy or (1-p[i]). We then multiply all these probabilities together. We repeat this step for all the values of  365>=n>= 100 and all the combinations of choosing n from 365 and add them all together:
